# Get Involved

### Getting Started

[Join our Slack Channel - #Pangenome_Browser](https://join.slack.com/share/I010JP8UMFT/nDnNhHyFXEHsPm9upxXSENub/enQtMTAxODc5MDk3MzUzNy1kNzY2MDU4NWVmMjdmNjI1NGM3NTc3ZTE2ZTNiNjU2MTA4MzExOTNmNzgyZTdlMzlkNjdmNWNlODZhNWRhZjlj).  
The hackathon is a great way to get started. We'll be doing a "pregame" for people who have available time and want to begin making a difference today.

You can get started [Setting Up Tools](tools.html) for communication and development.

Your efforts are greatly appreciated and may save many lives.
