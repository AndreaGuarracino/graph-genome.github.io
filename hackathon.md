# Pantograph Hackathon - April 6-10, 2020

## Hackathon Goal

COVID-19 Variants Analysis

As a vaccine is developed for any particular virus it matches specific details within the DNA. This will cause it to be effective on specific strands of the virus but will not work for other strands.

The variations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be studied to understand the mutations that are already in the population. This is crucial to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine.


We will analyze the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations. Looking at the sequencing of different samples will reveal the areas that have mutated.

Creating a better understanding of the virus mutations will likely improve the effectiveness of any vaccines that will be developed. We believe that ultimately this will save lives.
Our Strategy

Pangenome datasets are available the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pantograph is a pangenome browser that already exists. This tool can be used study variants of the virus.

Our short-term goal is to extend the Pantograph tool to add features to make it easier to study the SARS-CoV-2 virus variants.
