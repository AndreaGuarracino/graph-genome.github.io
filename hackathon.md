# Pantograph Hackathon - April 5-11, 2020

## Hackathon Goal

COVID-19 Variant Analysis

As a vaccine is developed for any particular virus it matches specific details within the DNA. This will cause it to be effective on specific strands of the virus but will not work for other strands.

The variations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be studied to understand the mutations that are already in the population. This is crucial to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine.


We will analyze the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations. Looking at the sequencing of different samples will reveal the areas that have mutated.

Creating a better understanding of the virus mutations will likely improve the effectiveness of any vaccines that will be developed. We believe that ultimately this will save lives.

## Our Strategy

Pangenome datasets are available for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pantograph is a pangenome browser that already exists. This tool can be used to study variants of the virus.  Our short-term goal is to extend the Pantograph tool to add features that will make it easier to study the SARS-CoV-2 virus variants.

There are a lot of tasks involved in managing a software development project.

* Project Management - breaking down tasks, Scrum, requirements, and people coordination
* Programming in React, Javascript, mobx
* Semantic Web using SPARQL
* Testing
* File wrangling - finding the latest sequence data and running the analysis pipeline
    * Docker, Linux
* Server setup - public facing server with data traffic  


### Call to Action
1. Email josiah@newline.us to express interest and ask questions.
2. Pick a Pantograph Project that fits your skills
3. Select an issue in the issues database to work on. 
4. Talk to Josiah on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/9703818860)
5. Submit a Pull Request once you've written the code.

### Expectations for Hackathon

The hackathon is a great way to get started with minimal commitment. Team leaders will help focus the development to ensure your success.
