## What is the Pantograph Project?

Pantograph is a pangenome browser that provides data visualization for showing variations due to mutation in DNA samples.


### COVID-19 Relevance

Pantograph as a project started in 2018 as a way to unlock the next level of population genetics for researchers. Pantograph is a visual browser for Graph Genomes, a new way of capturing sequence data. This process is designed to fix problems common to the sequencing technology that we’ve been using for the past 30 years. For example, Reference Bias means genetic analysis is more accurate for Europeans than for Africans ([Liverpool 2019](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2221957-genetic-studies-have-missed-important-gene-variants-in-african-people/)). A technical paper on Pantograph was being written by a team of 10 scientists before COVID-19 hit. 

Now, Pantograph is even more relevant to the current pandemic. The success or failure of our efforts to fight the COVID-19 disease rely upon the sequence diversity of the virus itself. Tests for infection rely on knowing the exact sequence being tested. A rearrangement in the order of genes, even if the content is the same, will return a false negative test. 

Second, the vaccine targeting the Spike protein on the outside of the virus relies on a lack of genetic diversity in the Spike protein sequence ([NIH clinical trial](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins)). If there are any strains with a mutant protein, the vaccine could be rendered ineffective and the virus would continue to spread. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that will likely infect billions of people, giving it a much higher mutation capability than we’ve previously dealt with in pandemics. For example, the common cold is so impossible to irradicate precisely because of the number of people infected and thus the high number of mutations which exist around the globe. Current sequencing techniques may be under-representing the full sequence diversity of the virus because they are reference based. Eliminating reference bias and enabling species genetic diversity on thousands of individuals is the core goal of using a graph genome.

Pantograph is a very small piece in a worldwide effort to eradicate this disease. It is by no means the most important and the disease will likely end without any involvement on our part. However, given the scale of the pandemic, even a tiny improvement or speedup can result in thousands of lives saved. That’s a difference which is worth investing our resources in. Pantograph will continue to be useful in a wide range of disease application after the current crisis is averted, so that we are never caught unprepared again.

Our short-term goal is to extend the Pantograph tool to add features to make it easier to study the SARS-CoV-2 mutants as the situation develops.

### Getting Involved

### Hackathon - April 5-11

We will be hosting a special event for volunteers to collaborate for one week. We hope to build the software to a point where we can analyze the variations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of April. Your contribution could be important to helping us stop this killer virus.

Join us to extend Pantograph so that it can be used to help with the COVID-19 outbreak.
